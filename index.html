 <p> In March my beautiful niece, Camila was born. It was one of the happiest and saddest days of my life. Due to complications at her birth, complications that I don't want to further discuss. Camila is the most precious baby alive. She is perfect in every way. She was born so early, but now she is back on track and growing every single day.</p>
 <p>I try to visit as much as possible. Sadly, I only get to see her on the weekends since I live in Athens because of college. During midterms though, I got so busy, studying for exams that I couldn't visit anymore. It got to the point that when I fianlly did make it home and tried picking Camila up, she didn't recognize me and cried. My heart broke that day, I almost started crying myself.</p>
 <p>Everything is better now though, she remembers her aunite and I plan on visiting her no matter what from now on, because I don't want to miss seeing her grow up and I don't ever want her to forget me again. I'm going to be the best auntie I can be.</p><br><br>
 <p> The table below details my emotional journey as Camila has gotten older.</p><br>
